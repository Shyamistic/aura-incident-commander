⚡ AURA: Autonomous SRE Platform"Reliability without humans. Safety without compromise."AURA is an enterprise-grade Autonomous Incident Response System designed to Detect, Diagnose, and Heal AWS infrastructure failures in seconds. Unlike traditional chatbots, AURA uses Shadow Mode to verify fixes in a sandbox before touching production, solving the "AI Trust Gap."🧠 The ArchitectureAURA is built on an Event-Driven, Multi-Agent architecture powered by Amazon Bedrock (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) and Amazon Q Developer.Code snippetgraph TD

🚀 Key Innovation: Shadow ModeMost AI agents are dangerous because they apply fixes directly to production. AURA introduces Shadow Mode:Simulation: The AI executes the remediation in a temporary, isolated sandbox.Verification: A "Supervisor Agent" checks metrics (Latency, Error Rate).Promotion: Only if the fix works in Shadow Mode does it apply to Production.✨ Features🛡️ Enterprise SecurityPII Redaction Engine: Automatically scrubs IP addresses, Emails, and API Keys from logs before they reach the LLM.RAG Compliance: The AI cites specific Corporate SOPs (e.g., "Policy SOP-001") to justify every decision.💰 FinOps IntelligenceCost-Aware Remediation: AURA calculates the financial impact of a fix before execution.Budget Guardrails: Prevents auto-scaling if the projected cost exceeds $50/day.🎙️ Jarvis Voice ControlNatural Language Ops: "Deploy production stack" or "Simulate memory leak."No-Code Interface: Operators command infrastructure without writing scripts.🔥 Chaos EngineeringBuilt-in Chaos Monkey: Intentionally injects faults (Latency Spikes, OOM, DB Crashes) to prove resilience.Self-Healing: Watch the system detect and fix the chaos in <10 seconds.🤖 Built with Amazon Q DeveloperThis project was accelerated using Amazon Q Developer for code generation, debugging, and documentation.Code ExplanationDocumentation Generation🛠️ Tech StackComponentTechnologyDescriptionFrontendHTML5 / CSS3 / JSDeployed on Netlify (Global Edge)BackendNode.js / ExpressDeployed on Render (Cloud Service)AI BrainAmazon BedrockPowered by Claude 3.5 SonnetCode GenAmazon Q DeveloperUsed for generating Lambda & CDK logicMonitoringAWS CloudWatchReal-time metric ingestionEventsAWS SNSEvent-driven architecture⚡ Quick StartPrerequisitesNode.js v18+AWS Credentials (with AdministratorAccess or scoped permissions)Amazon Q / Bedrock Access EnabledInstallationClone the RepoBashgit clone https://github.com/Shyamistic/aura-incident-commander.git
